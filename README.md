# Introduction:-
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous disasters in history. On April 15, 1912, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This tragedy has led to extensive analysis and numerous studies aimed at understanding the factors that influenced survival. In this project, I aim to analyze the Titanic dataset and build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival based on various passenger attributes.

This project involves the analysis of Titanic Survival data analysis using Pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to extract insights and trends. The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age,gender, ticket class, fare, cabin,and whether or not they survived.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived. The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from Kaggle.

# Objectives:-
* Data Exploration: Understand the structure and contents of the dataset.
* Data Preprocessing: Clean the data to handle missing values and convert categorical variables to numerical formats.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify key patterns and relationships in the data that may influence survival.
* Model Building: Train a machine learning model to predict passenger survival.
* Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.

# Analysis Steps:-
* Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.
* Load and Explore the Dataset: Load the dataset and explore its structure, summary statistics, and missing values.
* Preprocess the Data: Handle missing values, convert categorical variables to numerical, and normalize the data.
* Split the Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Build the Model: Choose a machine learning model and train it on the training set.
* Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the model's performance using the testing set.
* Make Predictions: Use the model to make predictions on new data.

# Files Included:-
* Titanic-Dataset.csv - The dataset used for analysis.
* Titanic dataset analysis.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis.

# Requirements:-
* Python 3
* Pandas
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

# Results:-
The results s presents the findings from our analysis and model building. This includes:

* Key insights from EDA, such as which factors significantly influenced survival.
* The performance of our predictive model, including accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
* Visualizations that illustrate the model's predictions and performance.
