This project involves the analysis of Titanic Survival data analysis using Pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to extract insights and trends. The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age,gender, ticket class, fare, cabin,and whether or not they survived.

Analysis Steps:-
1. Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.
2. Load and Explore the Dataset: Load the dataset and explore its structure, summary statistics, and missing values.
3. Preprocess the Data: Handle missing values, convert categorical variables to numerical, and normalize the data.
4. Split the Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Build the Model: Choose a machine learning model and train it on the training set.
6. Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the model's performance using the testing set.
7. Make Predictions: Use the model to make predictions on new data.
